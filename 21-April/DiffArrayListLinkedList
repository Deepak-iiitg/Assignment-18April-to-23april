
ArrayList fsat for accesing element but it is slow for adding element and deleting element.
LinkedList slow for accesing element but it is fast for adding and deleting element.

conclusion :- if we need more insertion and deletion operation , we should use LinkedList.
              if we need only acces element then we should use ArrayList.
